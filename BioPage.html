                        <p>Jumping ship from my original theme of movie soundtracks. Tackling more music education and taking a more unique approach to my second semester full of tunes. Each week will be a brand new show with the same host. Touching base on road trip jams, soft rock, one hit wonders, Forever 27 Club, spooky jams, lead female vocalists, ‚Äòthe transitioners‚Äô, any musician that came in contact with Eric Clapton, ‚Äòthe alternatives‚Äô, and of course the Halliday tunes. Maybe I‚Äôll throw a week of movie soundtracks in there for you nostalgic folksü§ô</p>

During the show, we alternate between music and conversation relevant to the week‚Äôs given theme.  Conversation is sometimes factual but also farcical and often zany. Past show themes have included ‚ÄúUnder the Sea,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe FDR Power Hour,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe One Where We Fill in for Joe Pesci.‚Äù  We also do investigative journalism in the style of ‚ÄòSerial,‚Äô but just in our spare time, not on the radio.  Tune to listen to two best friends who love the New Deal and each other.</p>

Legendary filmmakers including Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino utilize strong soundtracks in their films to make scenes of violence, chaos and corruption seem effortlessly cool and elevate the success of their films. ‚ÄúJust a Shot Away‚Äù takes a look at these epic cult-classic scenes and the music that made them so significant with a new theme each week ranging from directors to genres. A line from the Rolling Stones hit-song Gimme Shelter, ‚ÄúJust a Shot Away‚Äù is full of the sounds from cinema‚Äôs greatest camera shots. From classic rock and roll to Motown to Big Band music of the fifties, listen in and escape the afternoon slump with a trip down Hollywood boulevard.</p>

                        <p>A set of sounds from the beaches of Southern California. With bands straight out of LA, and others based across the country making waves (musically and literally) in the music world, Amoeba Beach is here for your surf music fix.</p>

                        <p>What are people talking about in the music scene? Big name artists with glamorous personality, fire beats and dope tracks right? Wrong! The new trend for artists is the crossover of genres. Musicians are tackling barriers from all over the music world. One of the most important movements is the reggaeton, trap, and all Hispanic music crossing over into English based music songs. My show will hopefully provide Latino/a/x and Hispanic heritage to Manhattan College.</p>
